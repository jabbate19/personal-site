            <p>As a member of the RITSEC Red Team, I developed a tool to use to compete in the many competitons we go
              to. My tool, named RShell, is an ICMP shell using raw sockets. It uses specific data tagged to the end of
              ICMP packets to indicate their command, and then the client sends an ICMP packet back to the server with
              the result. The interface used by the server is an ncurses TUI that gives you a variety of options for
              mass-sending commands and viewing your </p>

            <p>To create a larger variety of fast tools to automate a large quantity of my common Linux defense tasks, I
              developed a suite of various Python scripts to assist in Blue Team defense for Red vs Blue Competitions. I
              used my experience from classwork and competiting at University of Buffalo Lockdown to identify what was
              the most common attack methods and how I can automate my defense against them. Some of its features
              incluide automated auditing of accounts, configurations, and permissions to remove the low-hanging fruit.
              Furthermore, based off of my work on RustyBlue (See Below), I use network monitoring and process tracking
              to detect and eliminate reverse shells and similar malware.</p>

            <p>Looking to write more code in low-level languages and with cybersecurity competitions in mind, I chose to
              dive into Rust for this project. I have lately taken interest to netwoork analysis and monitoring, so I
              thought I would write something to help me during Blue Team competitions in Rust. Hence, RustyBlue was
              born! As of now, the project serves two functions. It has "sniff" mode, which essentially runs as
              Wireshark in the terminal. There is also "anomaly" mode, which follows a given YAML file to tell what data
              is safe and what may be an attacker. This was very fun to write since I had to manually parse the entire
              network packet layer by layer. The PCAP library provides each packet's data as an array of 8-bit integer
              values, so I then had to research the headers of each layer and protocol to ensure it is properly parsed
              and displayed.</p>

            <p>As part of the RITSEC Red Team Recruiting group, all members were tasked with creaeting a C2 (Command and
              Control) system. These consisted of a server software that would manage connections and send commands out
              to the clients, and client software to establish connections and execute any given command. Mine, written
              in python, was capable of executing shell commands and file upload/download. Alongside this, I wanted to
              find a fun way to interact with it that wasn't the command line. So, I made the command interface through
              a Skype chat! Each client gets its own "chat room" with the control account, with a large chat available
              to execute the same command on all clients.</p>

            <p>Everyone loves LEDs, right? But who likes getting up to get the remote to change them? This was the
              dilemma I faced in the Lounge at Computer Science House. In standard computer-geek fashion, I chose to fix
              it with a webiste. This project uses a Raspberry Pi, Flask Website, and WebSockets to control WS28xx
              lights. The website is hosted on an OKD cluster, and uses the websockets to control the Pis running a
              systemd service to run the lights. The proof of concept was done with 3 feet of lights, and I hope to add
              it to the actual lounge in much larger scale soon!</p>

            <p>In my Junior Year of High School, I was enrolled in the AP Capstone program and was tasked with a
              year-long research study on the topic of my choice. Wanting to further my skills in programming, I
              conducted research on different methods to complete traffic light state identification. Using Java and the
              OpenCV library to complete the task, this project was my first large code project that wasn't robotics
              related. This project also forced me to learn how to explain my complex ideas and algorithms in a way that
              normal people can understand. This project concluded with a 5000 word paper and a fifteen minute
              presentation on my findings.</p>
