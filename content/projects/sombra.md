As a member of the RITSEC Red Team, I developed a tool to use to compete in the many competitons we go to. My tool, named RShell, is an ICMP shell using raw sockets. It uses specific data tagged to the end of ICMP packets to indicate their command, and then the client sends an ICMP packet back to the server with the result. The interface used by the server is an ncurses TUI that gives you a variety of options for mass-sending commands and viewing your results!
