To create a larger variety of fast tools to automate a large quantity of my common Linux defense tasks, I developed a suite of various Python scripts to assist in Blue Team defense for Red vs Blue Competitions. I used my experience from classwork and competiting at University of Buffalo Lockdown to identify what was the most common attack methods and how I can automate my defense against them. Some of its features incluide automated auditing of accounts, configurations, and permissions to remove the low-hanging fruit. Furthermore, based off of my work on RustyBlue (See Below), I use network monitoring and process tracking to detect and eliminate reverse shells and similar malware.
