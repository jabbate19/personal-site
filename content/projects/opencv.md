In my Junior Year of High School, I was enrolled in the AP Capstone program and was tasked with a year-long research study on the topic of my choice. Wanting to further my skills in programming, I conducted research on different methods to complete traffic light state identification. Using Java and the OpenCV library to complete the task, this project was my first large code project that wasn't robotics related. This project also forced me to learn how to explain my complex ideas and algorithms in a way that normal people can understand. This project concluded with a 5000 word paper and a fifteen minute presentation on my findings.
