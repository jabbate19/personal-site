  <p>This past Friday, I gave a walkthrough presentation at RITSEC for their Week 1 Demo CTF: Intro to Linux!
    It was a great first presentation experience for the group and I hope to do more soon! I enjoyed getting
    to explain the basic concepts of Linux to new members and encouraging them to learn further!</p>
